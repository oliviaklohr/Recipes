[Honey Mustard Chicken Salad - Damn Delicious](https://damndelicious.net/2019/04/01/honey-mustard-chicken-salad/)

## Ingredients
1/3 cup whole grain Dijon mustard
2 green onions, thinly sliced
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1 tablespoon canola oil
4 slices bacon, diced
1 head romaine, roughly chopped
1 1/2 cups quartered strawberries
1 avocado, halved, seeded, peeled and sliced
1 cup corn kernels, canned or roasted

## Process
In a medium bowl, whisk together Dijon, green onions, olive oil, honey and vinegar; season with salt and pepper, to taste; set aside 1/3 of the mixture. Place remaining 2/3 of the mixture in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine chicken and reserved Dijon mixture; marinate for at least 2 hours to 6 hours, turning the bag occasionally. Drain the chicken from the marinade.

Preheat grill to medium heat.

Brush chicken with canola oil; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add chicken to grill, and cook, turning occasionally, until chicken is completely cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 10 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add bacon and cook until brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes. Drain excess fat; transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.

To assemble the salad, place romaine lettuce in a large bowl; top with chicken, bacon, strawberries, avocado and corn. Pour the Dijon dressing on top of the salad and gently toss to combine.
